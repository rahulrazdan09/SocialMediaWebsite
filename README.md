# SocialMediaWebsite
This project combines both MySql (E-R Diagrams, MySQL) and Python and HTML/CSS in order to create a website which functions like a social media website. This was written while taking a databases course (CS 460) with Professor George Kollios. We were provided some basic starter code for the python file and the starter code was written by a mixture of the Professor/TAs.
